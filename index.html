                    <p class="lead" data-i18n-key="intro_text">Money is one of the most influential institutions in human society. It shapes relationships, structures markets, and affects individual behavior. While economics studies how money functions in markets, the philosophy of money investigates what money is, what it means, and how it transforms human values. Economists, sociologists, and philosophers have long understood that money is a cultural and moral force that shapes human interaction, thought, and behavior rather than just a neutral tool for transactions.</p>

            <p data-i18n-key="theories_intro">Money mediates social relations, enabling both cooperation and competition. It can increase individual freedom by providing choice, but at the same time cause alienation, dependency, and inequality. Classical thinkers, from Aristotle and Cicero to the Stoics, explored how wealth and desires shape moral life.</p>
            
            <h4 class="mt-4" data-i18n-key="theory_commodity_h">Commodity Theory of Money</h4>
            <p data-i18n-key="theory_commodity_text"><strong>The commodity theory of money</strong> is an economic concept according to which the value of a medium of exchange derives essentially from the intrinsic value of the physical material from which it is made. Under this theory, money has intrinsic value because the underlying commodity (e.g., gold or silver) is desirable for its utility and non-monetary uses, such as in industry or jewelry. This theory suggests that money evolved over time as people chose the most sought-after, durable, and widely accepted commodities on the market for hoarding and trading. This perspective is sometimes referred to as metallism due to the historical role of precious metals in fulfilling this function.</p>
            
            <h4 class="mt-4" data-i18n-key="theory_credit_h">Credit Theory of Money</h4>
            <p data-i18n-key="theory_credit_text"><strong>The credit theory of money</strong> assumes that money is essentially a social and legal credit-debt relationship, rather than a physical commodity. Proponents of this theory argue that money originated as a unit of account used to measure obligations between parties. A monetary instrument, such as a banknote, functions as a claim by the holder against the debtor. In the modern financial system, most money is credit money created by commercial banks when they grant loans, which simultaneously creates a debt obligation. Therefore, the value of money does not derive from its intrinsic material value, but from confidence in the issuer's ability to repay or service the debt and the widespread acceptance of these claims as a medium of exchange</p>
            
            <h4 class="mt-4" data-i18n-key="theory_ontology_h">Social Ontology of Money</h4>
            <p data-i18n-key="theory_ontology_text"><strong>The social ontology of money</strong> is the study of the fundamental nature of money, which shows that it is primarily a social construct and an institutional fact. This concept states that money exists thanks to the collective attribution of a status function to a means of payment. This action gives this means the right to function as a medium of exchange and a store of value—which do not result from its physical properties. The reality of money is therefore sustained by shared beliefs and agreements, as well as trust in the system and its institutional support. This understanding is crucial to explaining fiat money, whose value depends solely on social status rather than intrinsic material value.</p>

                <p data-i18n-key="modern_text">The modern perspective views money as a special type of liability or financial asset that is not backed by any physical commodity, such as gold. The value of money derives solely from trust and social acceptance, primarily because the government declares it legal tender (meaning it must be accepted for all debts) and requires that taxes be paid only in that currency. Most importantly, modern money is mostly created by commercial banks through lending. The government (and its central bank) manages the overall supply of this money to maintain economic stability and control inflation, but most of the money supply circulating in the economy is this form of bank debt.</p>

                intro_heading: "Introduction - What Is Money?",
                intro_text: "Money is one of the most influential institutions in human society. It shapes relationships, structures markets, and affects individual behavior. While economics studies how money functions in markets, the philosophy of money investigates what money is, what it means, and how it transforms human values. Economists, sociologists, and philosophers have long understood that money is a cultural and moral force that shapes human interaction, thought, and behavior rather than just a neutral tool for transactions.",
                quote_aristotle: '"The greatest wealth is to live content with little." -Aristotele (De Officiis, I.33)',
                quote_cicero: '"Wealth is evidently not the good we are seeking; for it is merely useful and for the sake of something else." -Cicero (Nicomachean Ethics, IV.5)',
                intro_closing: "These ideas have been analyzed since the beginning. Ever since the concept of money was created, philosophers have been asking questions about it. Understanding its impact and effect on the human mind allows us to discover how the world works.",

                def_commodity_desc: "This theory states that money derives its value from the intrinsic worth of the material it is made of, such as gold or silver. Historically, valuable commodities became widely accepted as money because of their durability and usefulness.",

                def_ontology_desc: "The social ontology of money explains that money exists as a social construct created through collective agreement. Its value and function arise from shared beliefs, norms, and legal frameworks rather than physical characteristics.",
                theories_heading: "Major Philosophical Theories of Money",
                theories_intro: "Money mediates social relations, enabling both cooperation and competition. It can increase individual freedom by providing choice, but at the same time cause alienation, dependency, and inequality. Classical thinkers, from Aristotle and Cicero to the Stoics, explored how wealth and desires shape moral life.",
                theory_commodity_h: "Commodity Theory of Money",
                theory_commodity_text: "<strong>The commodity theory of money</strong> is an economic concept according to which the value of a medium of exchange derives essentially from the intrinsic value of the physical material from which it is made. Under this theory, money has intrinsic value because the underlying commodity (e.g., gold or silver) is desirable for its utility and non-monetary uses, such as in industry or jewelry. This theory suggests that money evolved over time as people chose the most sought-after, durable, and widely accepted commodities on the market for hoarding and trading. This perspective is sometimes referred to as metallism due to the historical role of precious metals in fulfilling this function.",
                theory_credit_h: "Credit Theory of Money",
                theory_credit_text: "<strong>The credit theory of money</strong> assumes that money is essentially a social and legal credit-debt relationship, rather than a physical commodity. Proponents of this theory argue that money originated as a unit of account used to measure obligations between parties. A monetary instrument, such as a banknote, functions as a claim by the holder against the debtor. In the modern financial system, most money is credit money created by commercial banks when they grant loans, which simultaneously creates a debt obligation. Therefore, the value of money does not derive from its intrinsic material value, but from confidence in the issuer's ability to repay or service the debt and the widespread acceptance of these claims as a medium of exchange",
                theory_ontology_h: "Social Ontology of Money",
                theory_ontology_text: "<strong>The social ontology of money</strong> is the study of the fundamental nature of money, which shows that it is primarily a social construct and an institutional fact. This concept states that money exists thanks to the collective attribution of a status function to a means of payment. This action gives this means the right to function as a medium of exchange and a store of value—which do not result from its physical properties. The reality of money is therefore sustained by shared beliefs and agreements, as well as trust in the system and its institutional support. This understanding is crucial to explaining fiat money, whose value depends solely on social status rather than intrinsic material value.",
                modern_heading: "Modern Money: Trust, Credit, and Fiat Currency",
                modern_text: "The modern perspective views money as a special type of liability or financial asset that is not backed by any physical commodity, such as gold. The value of money derives solely from trust and social acceptance, primarily because the government declares it legal tender (meaning it must be accepted for all debts) and requires that taxes be paid only in that currency. Most importantly, modern money is mostly created by commercial banks through lending. The government (and its central bank) manages the overall supply of this money to maintain economic stability and control inflation, but most of the money supply circulating in the economy is this form of bank debt.",
                quote_knapp: "“Money is a creature of law.” -Knapp (The State Theory of Money, 1905)",
                quote_innes: "“A sale and purchase is the exchange of a commodity for credit.” -Mitchell-Innes (Credit Theory of Money, 1914)",
                faq_heading: "FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions",
                faq_happy_q: "Can money buy happiness?",
                faq_happy_a: "The answer is complex. Philosophical perspectives suggest that money alone cannot create true happiness. Money can provide a certain amount of happiness by alleviating the stress associated with poverty and satisfying basic needs, but only to a certain extent. Once a certain imcome treshold is exceeded, more money does not significantly improve daily emotional well-being.",
                faq_study_q: "Why study the philosophy of money?",
                faq_study_a: "It helps us determine what money is—a commodity, a debt, or a social construct - by exploring its fundamental nature existence. This understanding is crucial for analysing financial systems, central banking, and the source of money's value beyond its materials.",
                faq_freedom_q: "How does money influence freedom?",
                faq_freedom_a: "Money influences freedom by expanding the choices available to an individual. It reduces dependency, enables autonomy, and allows people to pursue goals. However, a lack of money can limit freedom, create vulnerability, and reinforce social inequalities. Philosophers argue that money can both empower and constrain, depending on the social and economic system in which it operates.",

                theory_commodity_text: "<strong>La teoría de la moneda mercancía</strong> es un concepto económico según el cual el valor de un medio de cambio deriva esencialmente del valor intrínseco del material físico del que está hecho. Bajo esta teoría, el dinero tiene valor intrínseco porque la mercancía subyacente (por ejemplo, oro o plata) es deseable por su utilidad y usos no monetarios. Esta teoría sugiere que el dinero evolucionó con el tiempo a medida que la gente elegía las mercancías más buscadas y duraderas para el atesoramiento y el comercio.",

Los defensores de esta teoría argumentan que el dinero se originó como una unidad de cuenta utilizada para medir obligaciones entre las partes. En el sistema financiero moderno, la mayoría del dinero es dinero crediticio creado por bancos comerciales cuando otorgan préstamos. Por lo tanto, el valor del dinero no deriva de su valor material, sino de la confianza en la capacidad del emisor para pagar.",

Este concepto establece que el dinero existe gracias a la atribución colectiva de una función de estatus a un medio de pago. La realidad del dinero es, por lo tanto, sostenida por creencias compartidas y acuerdos, así como por la confianza en el sistema. Esta comprensión es crucial para explicar el dinero fiduciario.",
